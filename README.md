# Learning-TensorFlow

Assignment 1 had us complete the Tensorflow.js tutorial:
https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/transfer/image_classification

The Tensorflow.js tutorial was broken into 8 sections. The tutorial had us edit 
and re-edit the same files as we completed each section. I created appropriate folders 
based on which parts of the tutorial I was on.
